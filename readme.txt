== Description ==

Chosen Gamer is a gorgeous and mobile responsive theme for video game blogs, magazines, and podcasts. Built off the Chosen theme, Chosen Gamer has a minimalist aesthetic with sharp typography and a premium feel despite being a free theme. It's best used for blogging and creative sites. If you like the style, you can use it for other non-gaming niches too, such as news, travel, food, music, or corporate topics.
